# iris_classification
A high accuracy iris classification model based on k nearest neighbours .The model classifies a new set of attribute values including sepal and petal length etc.  into three categories setosa,virginica and versicolor.
k-Nearest Neighbours accuracy(using k=3) | 97.7778%.
mean accuracy while k varies from (1 to 30) | 94.79%.
Note:The prerequisites for the project are:seaborn,numpy,matplotlib,sklearn and pandas.
